# Simple Pulse-width modulator (PWM)
Displays Duty Cycles of user's input. Duty Cycles represents an interval or period of time that determines what type of signal will be sent during this time. User needs to input 3 main parameters: Duty cycle percentage, frequency, and number of cycles. 
Duty cycle will of course determine the how long will a HIGH or LOW signal will activate during a single cycle
Frequency determines how long a cycle lasts (in milliseconds)
Cycle repeats the Duty Cycle by an x amount of time
